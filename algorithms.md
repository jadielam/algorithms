# algorithms
Quick implementation of algorithms in Python

## Things to yet study:
1. (Done) Disjoint sets
2. (Done) multidimensional trees (nearest neighbors search). Very important
in the case of Twitter.
3. (Done) Heap review of change key and extract max
3. (Done) shortest path
4. (Done) minimum spanning tree
5. (Done) string search and match

# TODO:
1. Do exercises
2. Do Levenshtein distance in text
3. Do trie with Levenshtein distance in text
4. Study how to find running time of recursion
5. Study combinations and permutations, etc.

6. b-trees
10. matrix operations
7. radix sort
8. merkle trees
9. network flow

10.1 matrix multiplication
