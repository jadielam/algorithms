# algorithms
Quick implementation of algorithms in Python

## Things to yet study:
1. (Done) Disjoint sets
2. multidimensional trees (nearest neighbors search). Very important
in the case of Twitter.
3. shortest path
4. minimum spanning tree
5. string search and match
6. b-trees
7. radix sort
8. merkle trees
9. network flow
10. matrix operations
10.1 matrix multiplication
10.2 Q decomposition
10.3 LDA decomposition
